# Dyno.Core — device layer

Everything needed to talk to the STM32 over USB-CDC, with **no UI dependency** — so it is
unit-testable and headless-runnable. The Avalonia app ([[Dyno.App]]) is a thin shell on top.

## Layout
| Area | Type | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `Serial/` | `ISerialConnection`, `SerialConnection` | `System.IO.Ports` wrapper (115200 8-N-1); `COM3` ↔ `/dev/ttyACM0`. The interface lets tests inject a fake. |
| `Protocol/` | `StreamParser` | Decodes the **unframed** STM32 → PC stream into typed `DeviceMessage`s. |
| `Protocol/` | `UsbFrame` | Builds **framed** PC → STM32 commands (`[SOF][header][payload][crc16]`) and ports the CRC. |
| `Protocol/` | `ErrorDecoder` | Unpacks the 32-bit `error_code` (task / number / warning-flag). |
| `Messages/Generated/` | `Messages.cs` | Enums, packed structs and constants — **generated** from the firmware schema by [[message_gen]]. Do not hand-edit. |
| (root) | `DeviceClient` | Owns the connection, pumps bytes through the parser on a background loop, and correlates command RESPONSEs by `msg_id`. |

## Receive path (STM32 → PC)
The firmware emits `usb_msg_header_t`(12 B) + payload back-to-back with **no SOF/CRC** (USB
CDC is already reliable). `StreamParser.Append` accumulates bytes, reads each header, waits
for `payload_len` bytes, then dispatches on `(msg_type, task_offset)` to an
`OpticalEncoderSample` / `ForceSensorSample` / `BpmSample` / `TaskMonitorSample` /
`DeviceFault` / `CommandResponse` / `DeviceReady` / `SessionState` / `UnknownMessage`. A header
plausibility check gives best-effort resync if the stream is ever corrupted.

## Transmit path (PC → STM32)
`UsbFrame.BuildCommandFrame` wraps a `usb_cmd_header_t` (opcode + msg_id) + body in the
framed envelope with a CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE over header+payload. `DeviceClient.SendCommandAsync`
allocates a `msg_id`, writes the frame, and awaits the matching `USB_MSG_RESPONSE`.

## Handshake (device-announced)
The firmware streams **nothing** until the host acknowledges it. On connect it repeatedly
emits a `usb_device_ready_event` (`USB_MSG_EVENT` / `TASK_OFFSET_USB_CONTROLLER`) carrying its
`USB_PROTOCOL_VERSION`. `DeviceClient` decodes it to a `DeviceReady`, and — once per link —
checks the version against the host's generated `MessageConstants.USB_PROTOCOL_VERSION`:
- **match** → sends `USB_CMD_ACK` (body = the host version); on `USB_RSP_OK` it sets
  `IsHandshaked` and raises `Handshaked`, after which telemetry flows.
- **mismatch** → raises `ProtocolMismatch` and refuses to ack (the schemas are out of sync, so
  decoding the stream would be unsafe). This is the **runtime** counterpart to the build-time
  struct-size checks in `MessageContract`.
- **silence** → the device speaks first, so a board in the bootloader, a wedged firmware or simply
  the wrong port would leave the host waiting forever. `HandshakeTimeout` (5 s from `Start`) bounds
  that wait and raises `HandshakeTimedOut`. The link keeps listening afterwards — a device that
  turns up late still handshakes — and a refused version doesn't also fire it.

### Why the host also probes
**The firmware announces only while it has not been acked, and it never un-acks.** `_appReady` is
set by the first `USB_CMD_ACK` and nothing clears it — the board cannot even see the host leave,
since its `CDC_SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE` handler (where DTR would say so) is empty. So on every
*re*-connect to a board that stayed powered, no announcement is coming, and an announce-driven
handshake would hang forever.

So the host asks rather than waits: if no announcement arrives within `HandshakeProbeInterval`
(1 s), it sends an unsolicited `USB_CMD_ACK`. The firmware answers that in any state and
re-applying it is a no-op, so the probe both proves the device is alive and re-arms its streaming.
A freshly-booted board (announcing every 200 ms) handshakes long before the first probe is due, so
the probe is a fallback, not the normal path. A probe refused with `USB_RSP_VERSION_MISMATCH`
raises `ProtocolMismatch(null)` — the device rejected us without saying what it speaks.

*The firmware fix (clear `_appReady` on DTR deassert, so the board resumes announcing) is still
worth doing; the probe means the host works against boards already in the field.*

## Session state
The dyno streams sensor data **only while a session is running**, so the absence of samples means
nothing on its own — an idle board and a dead one look the same. The device therefore announces a
`session_state_event` (`USB_MSG_EVENT` / `TASK_OFFSET_SESSION_CONTROLLER`), decoded to a
`SessionState`: on every start/stop, *and* after every host `USB_CMD_ACK` even when unchanged.
`DeviceClient` tracks it as `IsSessionActive` and raises `SessionStateChanged` — but **only when
the value actually moves**, since the firmware re-states it on every 5 s heartbeat and the repeats
are not news.

That per-ack repeat is what makes the state recoverable rather than merely observable: a host
connecting to a steady board (idle, or already mid-session) learns the state without waiting for an
edge, and a host that declared the link lost — which clears `IsSessionActive`, since a device we
cannot reach is not one we can claim is running a session — has it restored by the ack that answers
the next heartbeat, with no reconnect.

Because `StreamParser` decodes in wire order and `DeviceClient` applies the session state *before*
re-publishing each message, `IsSessionActive` is already correct when the samples framed behind an
event are delivered. The app relies on that: it renders sensor readouts only while a session is
active, so a lagging flag would drop the first samples of every session.

## Heartbeat (liveness)
An open serial port does not mean a live device, and an idle device streams nothing — so after
the handshake `DeviceClient` re-sends `USB_CMD_ACK` every `HeartbeatInterval` (5 s) as a ping.
The firmware answers it from the USB controller itself and applying it twice is a no-op, so it
needs no dedicated opcode. Each answered ping raises `HeartbeatAcked` with its round-trip time
(the app logs a `[PING]` line); after `HeartbeatMissesBeforeLost` (2) unanswered ones the link is
declared lost: `IsHandshaked` clears and `ConnectionLost` fires. Polling **continues** through
the outage, so a device that comes back is picked up and re-raises `Handshaked` with no
reconnect. The raw response to this ack is a link keep-alive, not a command ack — the app filters
it out of the event log by `CommandResponse.Source` so it isn't logged twice.

## Threading
`DeviceClient.MessageReceived` fires on the read-loop thread; UI consumers must marshal to
their own thread (the app uses Avalonia's `Dispatcher`). `StreamParser` is single-reader,
not reentrant.
